                    <p>Hey there,

                        I'm Shikamaru Nara. Known as the laziest ninja in Konoha,
                        but there's more to me than just napping under the clouds.
                        Born and raised in the Hidden Leaf Village, I've mastered the art of laid-back living.
                        But don't let my chill vibe fool you‚ÄîI've got a mind sharper than any kunai.
                        My specialty? Shadow manipulation jutsu. When I'm not busy saving the world or
                        advising my friends, you can probably find me cloud watching or playing shogi.
                        So, if you ever need a strategist or a laid-back friend, you know who to call.
                        Later, Shikamaru Nara</p>

                        <p>Hey there,
                            Shikamaru Nara here. Let me tell you a bit about my old man. He was Shikaku Nara,
                            a true legend in his own right.
                            Dad was the head of the Nara clan and a master strategist, just like me.
                            He had this way of seeing through everything, like he could read the shadows themselves.
                            But what I admired most about him was his laid-back attitude. He taught me that
                            sometimes, you just gotta let things play out. It's all about conserving
                            your energy for when it really counts.
                            He wasn't one for flashy techniques or big battles. Instead, he focused on the long
                            game, always thinking ten steps ahead. Yeah, he might've seemed lazy to some,
                            but he was anything but.
                            In the end, Dad showed me that being a ninja isn't just about
                            strength and speed‚Äîit's about using your brain to outsmart your opponent.
                            And for that, I'll always be grateful.</p>
